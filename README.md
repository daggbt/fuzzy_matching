**Introduction**

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of synthetic data generation, fuzzy matching, and de-identification techniques. The notebook generates two dataframes, df1 and df2, using the Faker library to create synthetic records. To simulate real-world data, a few records from df2 are intentionally modified and appended to df1. The resulting dataframe is then reshuffled to simulate a real-world dataset.

**Fuzzy Matching**

The notebook applies a parallelized fuzzy matching algorithm to find matches between df1 and df2. The algorithm uses the FuzzyWuzzy library to compute the match score between each row in df1 and each row in df2. The matching dataframe is then filtered to include only the rows with a score above a certain threshold.

**De-identification**

Finally, the matching dataframe is de-identified by dropping columns with sensitive information. This step is essential to protect the privacy of individuals whose data is stored in the dataframe.

**Notebook Overview**

This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end process of generating synthetic data, applying fuzzy matching, and de-identifying sensitive information. The notebook provides a comprehensive example of how to apply these techniques in a real-world scenario.

**Getting Started**
To run the notebook, you will need to install the Conda environment and packages if you do not have already. Follow the steps below:

**Step 1: Install Conda**

If you don't have Conda installed on your system, you can download it from the official Conda website: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

**Step 2: Create a New Environment**

Create a new Conda environment by running the following command in your terminal:

``$ conda env create -f environment.yml``

This command will read the ``environment.yml`` file and install the specified packages within a new environment.

**Step 3: Activate the Environment**

Once you have the environment, activate the new environment by running the following command:

``$ conda activate link``
