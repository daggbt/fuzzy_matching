**Synthetic Data Generation, Fuzzy Matching, and De-identification**

This Jupyter notebook showcases techniques for generating synthetic data, performing fuzzy matching, and de-identifying sensitive information.

**Synthetic Data Generation (df1 & df2)**

1. Data Creation: The notebook utilizes the Faker library to create two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) containing synthetic records. These records may represent individuals, products, or any other entity depending on your specific use case.

2. Data Modification: A small subset of records from df2 is intentionally modified to introduce discrepancies. These changes could simulate real-world variations or errors in data.

3. Data Combination & Shuffling: The modified records from df2 are appended to df1, effectively creating a dataset with both clean and modified data points. Finally, the combined DataFrame is shuffled to randomize record order.

**Parallelized Fuzzy Matching**

1. Matching Algorithm: The notebook implements a parallelized fuzzy matching algorithm to identify matching records between df1 and the combined DataFrame (containing both original and modified records). Fuzzy matching helps account for inconsistencies or typos that might hinder exact string comparisons.

2. Matching Results: The algorithm outputs a new DataFrame containing only the records that exhibit a fuzzy match, potentially revealing the modified records within the combined dataset.

**De-identification**

1. Sensitive Information Identification: The notebook identifies columns that could potentially contain sensitive personal information (PI), such as names, addresses, or phone numbers.

2. De-identification Process: Sensitive columns are then dropped from the DataFrame containing the fuzzy matches, creating a de-identified version of the data suitable for further analysis while minimizing privacy risks.


**Benefits**

- Synthetic Data Generation: This technique allows you to work with realistic data structures and explore algorithms without compromising sensitive information.

- Fuzzy Matching: Fuzzy matching can be crucial for identifying potential duplicates or discrepancies that might not be apparent with exact string comparisons.

- De-identification: De-identification helps ensure data privacy by removing personally identifiable details while retaining the core information for analysis.



**Notebook Overview**

This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end process of generating synthetic data, applying fuzzy matching, and de-identifying sensitive information. The notebook provides a comprehensive example of how to apply these techniques in a real-world scenario.

**Getting Started**
To run the notebook, you will need to install the Conda environment and packages if you do not have already. Follow the steps below:

- **Step 1: Install Conda**

If you don't have Conda installed on your system, you can download it from the official Conda website: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

- **Step 2: Create a New Environment**

Create a new Conda environment by running the following command in your terminal:

``$ conda env create -f environment.yml``

This command will read the ``environment.yml`` file and install the specified packages within a new environment.

- **Step 3: Activate the Environment**

Once you have the environment, activate the new environment by running the following command:

``$ conda activate link``
